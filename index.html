        <p>My family has always enjoyed Gordon Lightfoots music.</p>  
        <p>Of the many songs we listen to this one has always been my favorite.</p>
        <p>Admittedly I didn't really understand the lyrics of Rainy Day People when I was a kid. But I always found the song calming.</p>
        <p>Today I understand the lyrics and can appreciate the song a lot more than I used too. </p>
